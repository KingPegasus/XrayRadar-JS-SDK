# Publish to npm on release.
# First publish: add NPM_TOKEN secret (Automation token from npmjs.com), then create a Release.
# After packages exist: add Trusted Publisher on each package's npm page (Settings → Trusted Publisher:
#   GitHub org/user, repo, workflow filename: publish.yml). Then you can remove NPM_TOKEN.
# Trigger: GitHub Release published or workflow_dispatch.
